# Multiple Resource Theory
A predictive model on the relative differences in task interference between different task configurations.

#### GUI Usage
1. In the GUI, select a task pair, check their task analysis and associated conflicts.
2. In the Jupyter Notebook inline, check multiple-resource 3D cube visualization and interference value plot from task pair selection history.

#### Parameter Shorthand Explanation
- Task Analysis Shell
    + PC = Perception & Cognition, R = Responding,
    + V (under Modalities) = Visual, A = Auditory,
    + V (under Codes) = Verbal, S = Spatial
- Conflict Matrix
    + A and V in the first position = Auditory and Visual
    + V and S in the second position = Verbal and spatial
    + C = Cognitive, R = Response
