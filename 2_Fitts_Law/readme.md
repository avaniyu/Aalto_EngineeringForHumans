# Fitts' Law
A predictive model of human movement, often used to model the act of pointing

#### GUI Usage
1. Sliders: to change object widths and in-between distance.
2. ID: Index of Difficulty calculated by object widths and in-between distance
3. Count down times: how many times are left to finish the current experiment session.
4. To get polynominal data fitting, you need to try at least 3 ID settings
5. To preview the experiment, you may `preload` our dataset, then `clear data` to carry out your own experiment.

#### Preassumption
1. Moving locus is 1D horizontal straight line
2. Start timing after tapping on either one of the two buttons
