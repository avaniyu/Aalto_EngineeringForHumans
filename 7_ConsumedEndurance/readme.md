# Consumed Endurance
A predictive model on the fatigue or consumed energy of a user from sustaining an interaction.

#### GUI Usage
1. Three vertical sliders: change joint angles to get real-time limb modelling and CE computation.
2. Anthropometrics table: check anthropometrics parameters.
3. Left graphical illustration: human upper limb gesture.
4. Right graphical illustration: associated upper limb modelling

#### Metrics Explanation
- __Strength__: The ratio between the average torque applied in the interaction and the maximum torque.
- __Endurance__: The time, in seconds, the person could sustain such interaction before needing to rest the arm.
- __Consumed Endurance__: The ratio of the interaction time and the computed endurance time.
