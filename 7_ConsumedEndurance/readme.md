# Consumed Endurance
> We interpret Consumed Endurance as the percentage of the energyt used or as the amount of fatigue.

### Endurance Metrics Explaination
**Strength**: The ratio between the average torque applied in the interaction and the maximum torque.   
**Endurance**: The time, in seconds, the participant could sustain such interaction before needing to rest the arm.   
**Consumed Endurance**: The ratio of the interaction time and the computerd endurance time.
